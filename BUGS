Known Bugs
==========

- Launcher fails miserably if '/dev/kvm' is not found on machines that have
  CONFIG_KVM enabled. Ingo Molnar suggested that we introduce sys_open_kvm_fd()
  syscall similar to what we've done for '/dev/epoll'. That should also make it
  easier to report to users when BIOS has disabled virtualization extensions.
